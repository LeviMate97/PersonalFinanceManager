# Project Overview

Welcome to my demo project, designed to showcase my skills as a full stack developer. This application integrates a front end built with TypeScript, React, and MUI, along with a backend developed in C#.

## Running the Project

The project can be run locally using SQL Server. Alternatively, it is hosted on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), utilizing Firestore for database management.

## Features

### 1. Personal Finance Management

This section is designed as a demo personal finance management tool with four main menus:
- **Dashboard:** Overview of your financial status.
- **Transactions:** Detailed list and management of transactions.
- **Categories:** Organization of expenditures by categories.
- **Accounts:** Management of different financial accounts.

Data is stored in Firestore on GCP and accessed through API calls to the C# backend, also hosted on GCP.

### 2. Cryptocurrency Tracker

This module establishes a basic connection to a public cryptocurrency price API to display current crypto prices.

### 3. Game Prices

This page allows users to search for video games and other products. The data is web scraped from [WeBuy](https://nl.webuy.com/) and displayed on the site.

### 4. ChatGPT Integration

This feature incorporates the ChatGPT API to enable analysis of transaction data from the Personal Finance Management section. Users can send transaction details directly to ChatGPT for insights, allowing for enhanced data interaction and analysis.
